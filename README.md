# 🌸 Bluebell SDK

**Elegant architecture for Kotlin Multiplatform. Inspired by nature. Engineered for scale.**

Named after the delicate *Hyacinthoides non-scripta*, **Bluebell** is a modular SDK and project template for Kotlin Multiplatform applications. It’s designed to help teams build secure, scalable, and maintainable apps across platforms—without the overhead of boilerplate or brittle wiring.
